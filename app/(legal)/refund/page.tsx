      <h2>Digital Goods</h2>
      <p>
        Invopap provides digital document downloads (PDF files). Once a document
        has been successfully generated and downloaded, the transaction is
        considered complete.
      </p>

      <h2>Refund Eligibility</h2>
      <p>We will issue a refund (KSh 10) in the following cases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Payment was charged but PDF download failed</strong> — If our
          system confirms payment but fails to generate or deliver the PDF due to
          a technical error on our end.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Double payment</strong> — If you were charged more than once
          for the same document due to a system error.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>M-Pesa deducted but payment not reflected</strong> — If M-Pesa
          confirms deduction but our system doesn&apos;t register the payment
          (callback failure).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Non-Refundable</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Successfully downloaded documents (the PDF was generated and
          delivered)
        </li>
        <li>Dissatisfaction with the document content you entered</li>
        <li>
          Payments cancelled by the user during M-Pesa PIN entry (these are
          not charged)
        </li>
      </ul>
