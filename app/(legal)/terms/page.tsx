      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Invopap (&quot;the Service&quot;). By accessing or using the Service, you
        agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree with
        any part of these terms, you must not use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Service Description</h2>
      <p>
        Invopap is a document generation platform designed to allow users to
        create professional invoices, receipts, estimates, and quotes. The
        Service provides flexibility by allowing users to create documents
        without an account (as guests) or to sign up for a persistent, registered
        account to manage their documents over time.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Account Registration and Guest Mode</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Guest Access:</strong> You may use the Service to generate
        documents without creating an account. Please note that guest session
        data is temporary and may be permanently deleted after 90 days of
        inactivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Registered Accounts:</strong> Signing up for a persistent account
        allows you to save and manage your documents long-term. You agree to
        provide accurate information during registration and are responsible for
        maintaining the security of your account credentials.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Pricing</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Free Features:</strong> Creating, editing, and previewing
        documents on the platform is completely free.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Premium Downloads:</strong> Downloading a clean, final PDF
        document (without the Invopap watermark) requires a one-time payment of
        <strong> KSh 10 per document</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Billing Responsibility:</strong> This fee is charged strictly to
        the document creator. The recipient of your invoice, receipt, estimate,
        or quote will never be charged by Invopap to view or receive the
        document.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Payments and Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Payment Processor:</strong> All payments are processed securely
        via Safaricom M-Pesa. By completing a payment on Invopap, you also agree
        to be bound by Safaricom&apos;s terms of service.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Refund Policy:</strong> Because the digital product is delivered
        instantly, payments are strictly non-refundable once a clean PDF has been
        successfully generated and downloaded. Attempting to circumvent payment
        requirements is strictly prohibited.
